# Software Rasterizer

Here is our CPU Software Rasterizer project made during our first Game Programming year. We had 4 weeks to make it in a group of 2.

# Content
The project is divided into 7 main features :

- Z-Buffer
- Phong (Per-Vertex)
- Blinn-Phong (Per-Pixel)
- Wireframe with Backface Culling
- Bilinear filtering
- Alpha-Blending
- Anti-aliasing

# External dependencies
For this project we used some external libraries :

- SDL2 to draw pixels on screen
- Stb_Image to import PNG files
